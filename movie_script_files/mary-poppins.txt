    All right, ladies and gents,
    
    
    
    
    
    Comical poems suitable for the occasion, extemporized and thought up before your very eyes.
    All right, here we go.
    
    
    
    
    
    	_Room here for everyone gather around_
    
    
    
    
    
    _The constable's "responstable." Now, how does that sound?_
    
    
    
    
    
    _Hello, Miss Lark I got one for you._
    
    
    
    
    
    _Miss Lark likes to walk in the park with Andrew._
    
    
    
    
    
    Hello, Andrew.
    
    
    
    
    
    	_Ah, Mrs. Cory a story for you._
    
    
    
    
    
    _Your daughters were shorter than you, but they grew._
    
    
    
    
    
    _Dear Miss Persimmon--_

    	_Wind's in the east, mist comin' in._
    
    
    
    
    
    _Like something is brewin' about to begin_
    
    
    
    
    
    _Can't put me finger on what lies in store_
    
    
    
    
    
    _But I feel what's to happen, all happened before._
    
    
    
    
    
    I'm sorry. Where was I? Thank you, one and all, for your kind support. Ah, Miss Lark, thank you.
    Crikey. Bless you, guv. Generosity itself, that's what you are. No charge.
    
    
    
    
    
    Oh, it's you! Hello. Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane, you say? All right. Come along with me. This
    here's Cherry Tree Lane. Nice little spot, you might say. Number 17's just down a bit. Now, this
    imposing edifice what first greets the eye, is the home of Admiral Boom, late of His Majesty's
    Navy. Likes his house shipshape, he does, shipshape and Bristol fashion at all times.

    What he's famous for is punctuality. The whole world takes its time from Greenwich. But
    Greenwich, they say, takes its time from Admiral Boom. What cheer, admiral?

    **Admiral Boom:**
    
    
    
    
    
    A word of advice, young man: storm signals are up at number 17. Bit of heavy weather brewing
    there.

    number 17, and no mistake.

    good riddance! I never liked her from the moment she set foot in the door.

    They must be somewhere. Did you look around the zoo in the park? You know how Jane and
    Michael is. Coo! You don't think the lion could've got at them, do ya? You know how fond they
    was of hangin' around the cage.

    Good evening, Katie Nanna, Ellen. We had the most glorious meeting! Mrs. Whitbourne-Allen
    chained herself to the wheel of the prime minister's carriage. You should've been there.

    Banks, shouldn't wonder if you weren't steering into a nasty piece of weather. Banks! Do you
    hear me?
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Hello, Katie Nanna. That must be heavy. Allow me.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Katie Nanna:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Hmph!
    
    
    
    **

    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    What a very pretty hat.
    
    
    
    
    
    	_I feel a surge of deep satisfaction_
    
    
    
    
    
    _Much as a king astride his noble steed - thank you._
    
    
    
    
    
    _When I return from daily strife, to hearth and wife_
    
    
    
    
    
    _How pleasant is the life I lead_

    Dear, it's about the children.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Yes, yes, yes.
    
    
    
    
    
    _I run my home precisely on schedule_
    
    
    
    
    
    _At 6:01 I march through my door_
    
    
    
    
    
    _My slippers, sherry and pipe are due at 6:02_
    
    
    
    
    
    _Consistent is the life I lead_
    
    
    
    **

    **Mrs. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    George, they're missing.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Splendid. Splendid.
    
    
    
    
    
    _It's grand to be an Englishman in 1910_

    _Are scrubbed and tubbed and adequately fed_
    
    
    
    
    
    _And so I'll pat them on the head and send them off to bed_
    
    
    
    
    
    _Ah, lordly is the life I lead_
    
    
    
    
    
    Winifred, where are the children?
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mrs. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    They're not here, dear.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    What? Well, of course they're here! Where else would they be?
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mrs. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    I don't know, George
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    You don't know?
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mrs. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Well, they're missing. Katie Nanna has looked everywhere.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Very well. I'll deal with this at once.
    
    
    
    
    
    Give me the police station, quickly, please.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mrs. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    I don't think we need bother the police, dear. The facts of the matter--
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Kindly do not attempt to cloud the issue with facts. One fact, and one fact alone is crystal clear!
    Katie Nanna's faltered at her post. She's let the family down. And I shall bring her to boo-- oh.
    She's left us, hasn't she?
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mrs. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Yes, dear, only just.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    What, uh-- yes. George Banks here. Yes. 17 Cherry Tree Lane. It's a matter of some urgency.
    I should like you to send a policeman around immediately.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mrs. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    The policeman's here, George!
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    What? Oh, how very prompt. What wonderful service. Thank you so much. Good night. Come
    in, constable. Come in.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Constable:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Thank you, sir. While going about my duties on the other side of the park, I noted some
    valuables that had gone astray. I believe they're yours, sir.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Valuables?
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Constable:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Come along, now. Come along.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mrs. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Jane! Michael!
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Winifred, please don't be emotional.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Constable:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Oh, I wouldn't be too hard on 'em, sir. They've had a long, weary walk today.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Children, come here at once. Well?
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Jane:**
    
    
    
    
    
    I'm sorry we lost Katie Nanna, Father. You see, it was windy. And the kite was too strong for us.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Constable:**
    
    
    
    
    
    In a manner of speaking, sir, it was the kite that ran away, not the children.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Thank you, Constable. I think I can manage this.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Jane:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Actually it wasn't a very good kite. We made it ourselves. Perhaps if you helped us to make
    one--
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Constable:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Ah, that's the ticket, sir. Kites are skittish things. Why, only last week with me own youngsters--
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    I'm very grateful to you, Constable, for returning the children. And I'm sure that if you go to the
    kitchen, Cook'll find you a plate of something.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Constable:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Thank you, sir. I shall now return to my duties.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Jane:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Thank you, Constable.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Constable:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Good night, miss. Good night, ma'am. Good night, sir. Cook'll find me something. I never--
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mrs. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    I'm awfully sorry about this, George. I'll expect you'll want to discuss it.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    I would indeed! Ellen, take Jane and Michael upstairs straightaway.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Ellen:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Yes, sir. I knew it. When all's said and done, who bears the brunt of everything around here?
    Me, that's who! They don't want an honest, hard-workin' girl around here. They need a ruddy
    zookeeper.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mrs. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    I'm sorry, dear, but when I chose Katie Nanna, I thought she would be firm with the children. She
    looked so solemn and cross.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Winifred, never confuse efficiency with a liver complaint.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mrs. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    I'll try to do better next time.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Next time? My dear, you've engaged six nannies in the last four months! And they've all been
    unqualified disasters.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mrs. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    I quite agree.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Choosing a nanny for the children is an important and delicate task. It requires insight, balanced
    judgment, and an ability to read character. Under the circumstances, I think it might be apropos
    to take it upon myself to, uh, select the next person.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mrs. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Oh, would you, George?
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Obviously the way to find a proper nanny, is to go about it in a proper fashion. I shall put an
    advertisement in The Times. Take this down please.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mrs. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Yes, of course, dear.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Wanted. Uh, no. Uh, required. Nanny: firm, respectable, no nonsense.

    _In short you have a ghastly mess_
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mrs. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Splendid, George! Inspirational. The Times will be so pleased.
    
    
    
    **

    **

    Yes?

    **
    
    **Jane:**
    
    
    
    
    
    We've discussed everything, and we're very sorry about what we did today.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    I should certainly think so.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Jane:**
    
    
    
    
    
    It was wrong to run away from Katie Nanna.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    It was indeed.

    **
    
    **Jane:**
    
    
    
    
    
    We thought you would. That's why we wrote this advertisement.

    Thank you. Most interesting. And now I think we've had quite enough of this nonsense. Please
    return to the nursery.

    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    I'm well aware they're just children, Winifred. I only congratulate myself that I decided to step in
    and take a hand. "Play games, sing songs, give treats." Ridiculous. There's no question in my
    mind whatsoever. Now is the time for action.
    
    
    
    
    
    Give me The Times, please. No, I do not know the number.

    Of course not. Witches have brooms.

    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Well, well ye-- yes, of course, I mean. Uh-- you brought your references, I presume. May I see
    them?

    **
    
    **Mary Poppins:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Oh, I make it a point never to give references. A very old-fashioned idea to my mind.

    **Mary Poppins:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Now then, the qualifications. "Item one: a cheery disposition." I am never cross. "Item two: rosy
    cheeks." Obviously. "Item three: play games, all sorts." Well, I'm sure the children will find my
    games extremely diverting.

    **
    
    **Mary Poppins:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Excuse me. "Item four: you must be kind." I am kind, but extremely firm. Have you lost
    something?

    On second thoughts, I believe a trial period would be wise. Hmm. I'll give you one week. I'll know
    by then. I'll see the children now. Thank you.

    hoped she be?

    **
    
    **Mrs. Banks:**

    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    You know, Winifred, I think she will. I think she will.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mrs. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    In that case, perhaps you'd better tell Ellen to dismiss the others.

    It is rather like a bear pit, isn't it?
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Michael:**
    
    
    
    
    
    That's a funny sort of bag.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mary Poppins:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Carpet.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Michael:**
    
    
    
    
    
    You mean to carry carpets in?
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mary Poppins:**
    
    
    
    
    
    No. Made of.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Jane:**
    
    
    
    
    
    This is your room, and there's a lovely view of the park.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mary Poppins:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Hmm. Well, it's not exactly Buckingham Palace. Still, it's clean. Yes, I think it will be quite
    suitable. Just needs a touch here and there. Well, first things first. I always say, the place to
    hang a hat is on a hat stand. Ah! This will never do! I much prefer seeing all of my face at the
    same time.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Michael:**
    
    
    
    
    
    There-- but there was nothing in it.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mary Poppins:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Never judge things by their appearance. Even carpetbags. I'm sure I never do. A thing of beauty
    is a joy forever. Mmm, a little more light, perhaps.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Michael:**
    
    
    
    
    
    We better keep an eye on this one. She's tricky.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Jane:**
    
    
    
    
    
    She's wonderful.

    **
    
    **Mary Poppins:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Much better! Now, let me see. That's funny. I always carry it with me. It must be here
    somewhere.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Michael:**
    
    
    
    
    
    What?
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mary Poppins:**
    
    
    
    
    
    My tape measure.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Michael:**
    
    
    
    
    
    What do you want it for?
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mary Poppins:**
    
    
    
    
    
    I want to see how you two measure up. Well, that's the funniest thing I ever saw. I know it's
    down here somewhere. Ah, ha-ha, ha-ha! Here it is. Good. Come along, then. Quickly. Head up,
    Michael. Don't slouch. Just as I thought. Extremely stubborn and suspicious.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Michael:**

    **
    
    **Mary Poppins:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Suspicious.
    
    
    
    
    
    Now you, Jane. Mmm. "Rather inclined to giggle. Doesn't put things away."
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Michael:**

    **
    
    **Mary Poppins:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Very well. Hold this for me. As I expected. "Mary Poppins. Practically perfect in every way."
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Jane:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Mary Poppins! Is that your name? It's lovely.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mary Poppins:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Thank you. I've always liked it. Now, shall we get on with it?
    
    
    
    **

    **Mary Poppins:**
    
    
    
    
    
    In your advertisement, did you not specifically request to play games?
    
    
    
    **

    Mary Poppins is taking us to the park.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Bert:**
    
    
    
    
    
    To the park? Not if I know Mary Poppins. Other nannies take children to the park. When you're
    with Mary Poppins, suddenly you're in places you've never dreamed of. And quick as you can
    say "Bob's your uncle," the most unusual things begin to happen.

    **
    
    **Bert:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Well mind, it's not my place to say, but what she's probably got in mind, is a jolly holiday
    somewheres or other. Something along these lines, I shouldn't be surprised. "Punting on the
    Thames." That's always good if you like an outing. Here we go.
    
    
    
    
    
    The circus. How about a lovely circus? Lions and tigers. World-famous artistes performing
    death-defyin' feats, of dexterity and skill before your very eyes. Ta-da! Ta-da!

    Beautiful, ain't it? A typical English countryside, as done by a true and lovin' hand. Though you
    can't see it, there's a little country fair down that road and uh, over the hill.

    **Mrs. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    After our meeting at the Albert Hall, we're all going to Downing street, to throw things at the
    prime minister. Oh, how distinguished you look this morning, George.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    What's all that fearful caterwauling in the kitchen?
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mrs. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    It's cook singing.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Cook singing? What's wrong with her?
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mrs. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    She's happy as a cricket. As a matter of fact, since you hired Mary Poppins, the most
    extraordinary thing seems to have come over the household.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**

    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mrs. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Take Ellen for instance. She hasn't broken a dish all morning.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Really? Well, that is extraordinary.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mrs. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    And another thing. She and Cook usually fight like cats and dogs, but today--

    **Mrs. Brill:**

    **Ellen:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Thanks ever so, ducks.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Ellen, stop making that offensive noise! And shut the window! That bird's giving me a headache.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Ellen:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Yes, sir. Quiet! You're giving the master a headache.

    **Mrs. Banks:**

    **Mr. Banks:**

    confoundedly cheerful!

    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mrs. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    I don't think there's anything to explain, do you? It's obvious that you're out of sorts this morning.
    The children just came in to make you feel better.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    I should like to make one thing quite clear, once and for all. I am not out of sorts. I am in a
    perfectly equable mood. I don't require being made to feel better!
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mrs. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    But you're always saying that you wanted a cheerful and pleasant household.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Winifred, I should like to make a slight differentiation between the word cheerful and just plain
    giddy irresponsibility.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mrs. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Excuse me, dear. Posts, everyone, please!
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    I have no objection to anyone being cheerful or pleasant. But I do expect a certain decorum. I
    can tell you one thing, Winifred. I don't propose standing idly by and letting that woman, Mary
    Poppins, undermine the discipline and-- there's something odd, I may say extremely odd about
    the behavior of this household since that woman arrived. And I want you to know that I've
    noticed it!

    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    One thing more.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mrs. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Yes, dear?
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    I suggest you have this piano repaired. When I sit down to an instrument, I like to have it in tune.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mrs. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    But, George, you don't play.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Madam, that is entirely beside the point!
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mary Poppins:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Now, let me see. First of all, we must go to the piano tuners. And then we go to Mrs. Cory's sh--
    Mrs. Cory's shop for some gingerbread.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **

    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mary Poppins:**
    
    
    
    
    
    And then we go to the fishmonger's, I think, for a nice dover sole and a pint of prawns. Uh,
    Michael, stop stravaging along behind.

    Bless you. Well, yes, of course. There's not a moment to lose. I'll go straightaway. And thank
    you very much.

    Andrew, worrying won't help anyone. Why don't you go home and put your feet up?

    Oh, I kn-- I know, I-- but I tried. Really, I did, my dear. I-- but I so enjoy laughing, you know? And,
    well-- and when I start, it's all up with the-- that's what happens to me. I love to laugh! Oh, my
    goodness! I can't help it. You can see that. I just like laughing, that's all.

    **Bert:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Yes, whatever you do, keep a straight face. Last time, it took us three days to get him down.

    Well, I had hoped that maybe, that you would just, that-- splendid! Thank you very much! Keep
    your feet back. Mind the bread and butter. Now, watch it, children.
    
    
    
    **

    Next thing, I suppose, you'll be wanting me to pour out. Oh, well. If I must, I must. If you'll just
    stop behaving like a pack of laughing hyenas! Two lumps, uncle Albert?
    
    
    
    **

    **  
      
    **
    
    **Uncle Albert:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Oh, yeah. Uh, speaking of weather, the other day when it was so cold, a friend of mine went to
    buy some long underwear, you know. The shopkeeper said to him, "How long do you want it?"
    and my friend said, "Well, from about September to March."

    Albert.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Uncle Albert:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Oh, thank you, my dear. I'm having such a good time. I wish that you could all stay up here all
    the time.

    We'll jolly well have to. There's no way to get down.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Uncle Albert:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Oh, no, there is a way. Frankly I, I don't like to mention it, because you have to think of
    something sad.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mary Poppins:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Then do get on with it, please!
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Uncle Albert:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Let me see. I've got the very thing. Yesterday when the lady next door answered the bell, there
    was a man there. And the man said to the lady, "I'm terribly sorry. I just ran over your cat."
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Jane:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Oh, that's sad.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Michael:**
    
    
    
    
    
    The poor cat.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Uncle Albert:**
    
    
    
    
    
    And then the man said, "I'd like to replace your cat." and the lady said, "That's all right with me,
    but how are you at catching mice?"
    
    
    
    
    
    Well, you know I started out sad. I, I try, really I do. But, but everything ends up so hilarious, I
    can't-- I can't help--
    
    
    
    
    
    **Mary Poppins:**
    
    
    
    
    
    That will be quite enough of that! It's time to go home.
    
    
    
    **

    **Jane:**

    **  
      
    **
    
    **Michael:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Oh, no!
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Uncle Albert:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Oh, that's sad. That's the saddest thing I ever heard.
    
    
    
    **

    **  
      
    **
    
    **Uncle Albert:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Must you really go? You know, people come to see me all the time, you know. And, and we have
    such a lovely time, and then they have to go home. And, and I'm very, very sad about the whole
    thing.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Michael:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Don't worry. We'll come back soon.

    **
    
    **Bert:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Uncle Albert, I got a jolly joke I saved for just such an occasion. Would you like to hear it?
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Uncle Albert:**
    
    
    
    
    
    I'd be so grateful.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Bert:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Righto. Well, it's about me granddad, see? And one night, he had a nightmare, he did. So
    scared that he chewed his pillow to bits. Yes. To bits.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Uncle Albert:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Yes.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Bert:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Next morning I says, "How do you feel, granddad?"
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Uncle Albert:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Yes.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Bert:**
    
    
    
    
    
    He says, "Oh, not bad. A little down in the mouth!"
    
    
    
    
    
    Yeah, I always say there's nothing like a good joke.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Uncle Albert:**
    
    
    
    
    
    No. And that was nothing like a good joke! That-

    **
    
    **Admiral Boom:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Bit late tonight, aren't you, Banks? I say, Banks! Is anything the matter, Banks? Banks!

    Want to hear a joke?
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Jane:**
    
    
    
    
    
    We had the most wonderful afternoon with Mary Poppins.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Michael:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Speaking of afternoons, the joke goes like this. I know a man with a wooden leg named Smith.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Smith? We don't know anyone called Smith.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Michael:**
    
    
    
    
    
    And there was a second chap, and the second chap says, "What's the name of his other leg?"
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Jane:**
    
    
    
    
    
    And we had a lovely tea party on the ceiling!
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Oh, children, please be quiet.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Jane:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Mary Poppins says if we're good, she'll take us there again.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Oh. Oh, Mary Poppins said that, did she? Will you please return to your room. Mary Poppins,
    will you be kind enough to come with me?
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mary Poppins:**
    
    
    
    
    
    As you wish.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Mary Poppins, I very much regret what I must say to you.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mrs. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Good evening, George. Is anything the matter?
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    I'm afraid there is.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mrs. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    I, I'd love to stay, but I have to dress for my rally in Hampstead.

    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**

    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Mary Poppins, I must confess I am extremely disappointed in you.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Ellen:**
    
    
    
    
    
    She's for it now. I've heard the master do this speech before.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    I don't deny that I am partially responsible for allowing the children to spend their days on
    worthless frivolity to the exclusion of all else! But it is high time they learned the seriousness of
    life!
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mrs. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    But, George, they're only children.

    In short, I am disturbed to hear my children talking about popping in and out of chalk pavement
    pictures, consorting with racehorse persons, fox hunting. Yes, well I don't mind that quite so
    much. At any rate, it's traditional. But tea parties on the ceiling? I ask you. Having tea parties on
    the ceiling and highly-questionable outings of every other kind!

    There's something wrong. The bank won't give someone their money!

    **
    
    **Bert:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Oh, perhaps a smudge or two. It so happens that today I'm a chimney sweep.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Jane:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Oh, Bert, we're so frightened.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Bert:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Now, now, don't take on so. Bert'll take care of you like I was your own father. Now, who's after
    you?
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Jane:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Father is.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Bert:**
    
    
    
    
    
    What?
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Michael:**
    
    
    
    
    
    He brought us to see his bank.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Bert:**
    
    
    
    
    
    I don't know what we did, but it must've been something dreadful.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Michael:**
    
    
    
    
    
    He sent the police after us, and the army and everything.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Jane:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Michael, don't exaggerate.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Bert:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Well, now, there must be some mistake. Your dad's a fine gentleman and he loves ya!
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Jane:**
    
    
    
    
    
    I don't think so. You should've seen the look on his face.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Michael:**
    
    
    
    
    
    He doesn't like us at all.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Bert:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Well, now that don't seem likely, does it?
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Jane:**
    
    
    
    
    
    It's true.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Bert:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Let's sit down. You know, begging your pardon, but the one my heart goes out to is your father.
    There he is in that cold, heartless bank day after day, hemmed in by mounds of cold, heartless
    money. I don't like to see any living thing caged up.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Jane:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Father in a cage?
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Bert:**
    
    
    
    
    
    They makes cages in all sizes and shapes, you know. Bank-shaped some of 'em, carpets and
    all.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Jane:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Father's not in trouble. We are.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Bert:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Oh, sure about that, are you? Look at it this way. You've got your mother to look after you. And
    Mary Poppins, and Constable Jones and me. Who looks after your father? Tell me that. When
    something terrible happens, what does he do? Fends for himself, he does. Who does he tell
    about it? No one! Don't blab his troubles at home. He just pushes on at his job, uncomplaining
    and alone and silent.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Michael:**
    
    
    
    
    
    He's not very silent!
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Jane:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Michael, be quiet. Bert, do you think Father really needs our help?
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Bert:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Well, not my place to say. I only observe that a father can always do with a bit of help. Come on,
    I'll take you home.

    **
    
    **Bert:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Oh, rightly so! A chimney is a wondrous thing. She's built tall right up there on the roof. When
    the wind is just right, it blows across her top, then draws the smoke right up the flue. Here. Feel
    the pull on the end of that brush. It's like I got a whale on the end of the line, ain't it? Michael,

     Why, yes, Banks. It's extremely serious.

    **Mr. Dawes (Snr):**

    Yes, Mr. Dawes. I shall be there at 9:00.

    Come in!
    
    
    
    
    
    Take your hat off, Banks.

    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Good evening, gentlemen.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Dawes (Snr):**
    
    
    
    
    
    Well, get on with it. Go on.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Dawes:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Uh, yes, Father. In 1773, an official of this bank, unwisely loaned a large sum of money, to
    finance a shipment of tea to the American colonies. Do you know what happened?
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Yes, sir. Yes, I think I do. Uh, uh, as the ship lay in Boston harbor, uh, a party of the colonists
    dressed as Red Indians, uh, boarded the vessel, behaved very rudely, and, and threw all the
    tea overboard. This made the tea unsuitable for drinking, even for Americans.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Dawes:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Precisely. The loan was defaulted. Panic ensued within these walls. There was a run on the
    bank!
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Dawes (Snr):**
    
    
    
    
    
    From that time to this, sir, there has not been a run on this bank until today! A run, sir, caused
    by the disgraceful conduct of your son. Do you deny it?
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    I do not deny it, sir. And I shall be only too glad to assume responsibility for my son.

    Oh, yes. It is a word. A perfectly good word, actually. Do you know what there's no such thing
    as? It turns out, with due respect, when all is said and done, that there's no such thing as you!

    Or I might seize a horse off a merry-go-round, and win the derby! Or I might just fly a kite! Only

    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mary Poppins:**
    
    
    
    
    
    And what would happen to me, may I ask, if I loved all the children I said good-bye to?
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Constable:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Yes, sir, that's right. George W. Banks. 17 Cherry Tree Lane. About six foot one, I'd say, sir. Oh,
    yes, we rang up his bank first thing this morning. The only thing we discovered was, he'd been
    discharged last night. No telling what he might do in a fit of despondency.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Ellen:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Wouldn't hurt to have them drag the river. There's a nice spot there by Suffolk bridge. Popular
    with jumpers.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mrs. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Really, Ellen!
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Constable:**
    
    
    
    
    
    He seemed to have been a fine, stable gentleman, sir. No hanky-panky, if you know what I
    mean. Oh, regular habits, sir. Well, far as anyone knows.

    Or something that sounds like him.

    **
    
    **Constable:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Mrs. Banks, could we have a little less noise on the premises? I can't make out what the
    inspector's sayin'.
    
    
    
    **

    **Mrs. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    George! Oh, George, you didn't jump in the river. How sensible of you.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Constable:**
    
    
    
    
    
    It's all right, sir. He's been found! No, alive! Or so I presume. He's a-kissin' a-Mrs. Banks.
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mrs. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    I've been so worried. What happened at the bank?
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    I've been sacked, discharged, flung into the street.

    **Ellen:**
    
    
    
    
    
    Gone off his crumpet. That's what he's done.

    **Mrs. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    George, what on earth were you doing in the cellar?
    
    
    
    **  
      
    **
    
    **Mr. Banks:**
    
    
    
    
    
    You'll see in a moment. Where are the children? Jane? Michael?
    
    
    
    **

    Your father's calling you.

    **Michael:**
    
    
    
    
    
    It doesn't sound like Father.
